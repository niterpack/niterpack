**üõ†Ô∏è Heavily under development - release candidate versions only**

Niter is a modern command-line tool for creating Minecraft modpacks.
It uses TOML format, which allows the modpack to be easily version-controlled using [git](https://git-scm.com/) or other tools.
Because of the command-line nature, it can also be implemented with continuous integration.
Its interface is easy to use and is inspired by Rust's package manager [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo).

## Features

- Easy to use command-line interface
- TOML format, which can be version-controlled
- Adding mods from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/)
- Building modpacks into a usable installation

More features are yet to be added, and you can request more using [the issue tracker](https://github.com/panda885/niter/issues).

## Install

Currently, you can download pre-built binaries from [the GitHub release page](https://github.com/panda885/niter/releases/latest) or install using [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo):

```sh
cargo install niterpack
```

## Usage

Create a new modpack using the `init` command:

```sh
niter init # Creates a new project in the current directory
```

Add your favorite mods from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/):

```sh
niter add <MOD> # Adds a new mod to the current project
```

Build the project:

```sh
niter build # Builds the current project
```

Your modpack is now available under `build/installation`.
